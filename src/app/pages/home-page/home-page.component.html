      <h1 class="title main">Rationale.</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Forms are complicated, inconsistent and difficult to test.</h2>
      <p>ng2 Simple Forms aims to provide a simple wrapper for Angular Reactive Forms, to make it easy to create full forms, in an accessible, testable and consistent way.</p>
      <h2 class="subtitle">How?</h2>
      <p>
        By exposing a simple interface for creating form elements, and complete forms, ng2-simple-forms allows you to concentrate on more important things, and by implementing auto-generated test IDs
        (think, Protractor, etc) and accessibility options (configurable, of course), along with WAI compliant mark-up in presentational components, you can generate a form in
        multiple ways and still end up with a consistent, accessible approach across the project.

        ng2 Simple Forms <span class="strike">is available</span> will be available via npm, once it's complete. This is very much a work in progress. In the meantime, it's available as full modular
        project on <a href="https://github.com/jflynn7/ng2-simple-forms" target="_blank">Github</a>.
