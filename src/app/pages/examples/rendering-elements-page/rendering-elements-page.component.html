    <h2 class="subtitle">One component to render them all...</h2>
    <p>
      In simple-forms, there are presentational components for each type of form element (text, select, radio, datepicker, etc),
      but, in order to render them, we use a single smart component <code>app-form-element</code>.

    <h1 class="title">Single Wrapper Component Method</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">This method for rendering requires no knowledge of the element type prior to rendering (recommended)</h2>
    <p>
      As shown in previous examples, rendering a form element is as simple as...
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint"><code>{{ simpleElementCode }}</code></pre>
    <p>
      ...which will render an element, based on the <code>formElement</code> passed to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the hood of <code>app-form-element</code> a simple switch determines which presentational component to render based on the
      <code>type</code> of the element passed through to it. Nothing clever there. It simply serves as a consistent wrapper around the
      presentational components. The idea of a single wrapper becomes really useful when using a <a [routerLink]="'/wrapped-form'">
      wrapped form</a>, as we can simply take an array of elements in our component, and loop over them, rendering them all inline without
      any additional code, or requiring <strong>any</strong> knowledge of each elements type:
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-html"><code>{{ loopCode }}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Using the wrapper in either of the above ways, assumes you've created a <a [routerLink]="'/formgroups'">FormGroup</a> for your form elements, and you pass it in as
      the <code>[formGroup]</code> property of <code>app-form-element</code>. There are, of course, ways to use the presentational components
      without the wrapper, which is covered in the next section. Additionally, <code>SimpleFormBuilder</code> has a number of utility methods
      that make creating and rendering forms even easier, which are covered in the <a [routerLink]="'/unwrapped-form'">unwrapped form</a> section
      of this documentation.

    <h2 class="subtitle">Using presentational components without a FormGroup</h2>
    <p>
      From time to time, you'll want to use the presentational components outside of the context of a complete form,
      perhaps for a search box? In this scenario, you probably don't need to make a FormGroup, so simple-forms provides a
      built in FormGroup for each presentational component (via a <code>toOwnFormgroup()</code> function) so it creates its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using a presentation component in this way, the same validation and accessibility options apply, the only difference is,
      you'll need a function to listen to the data entered into the field, which should subscribe to <code>(changeEmitter)</code> as
      follows...
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint"><code>{{ noFormGroupExample }}</code></pre>
    <p>
      ...where <code>myFunction($event)</code> is a function in your component that does something with the value of the component.
      <code>changeEmitter</code> emits a <a [routerLink]="'/api/ComponentValue'">ComponentValue</a> object when the component value changes,
      which has three properties;<br>
      <br><code>inputId</code>, which is the <code>inputId</code> of the element emitting the value (useful if you use one function to listen to all elements).
      <br><code>value</code>, which is the current value of the component.
      <br><code>isValid</code>, which, like the name says, determines if the field is valid or not (based on your <code>FormElement</code> objects validation options.

      <h1 class="title">Single Element (without FormGroup)</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Use one function, to receive all values.</h2>
      <p>
        The example below uses a single function in the component to receive all values (<code>getSingleElementValue()</code>), but you could
        write a function for each, it's up to you. All you really need to know is that your function will receive an object that looks like...
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>{{'{'}} inputId: 'yourElementInputId', value: 'a value', isValid: true {{'}'}}</code></pre>
      <p>
        ... each time the field value changes. What you do with it from there is up to you! ðŸ‘Œ In the example below, the single function used
        looks like...
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>{{singleFunctionDef}}</code></pre>
      <p>
        ...here, we used a switch on the <code>$event</code> values <code>inputId</code> to determine which field was sending the value, but
        a series of <code>if..else</code> would work just as well. Conversely, if you used a different receiving function on each field, you
        wouldn't need to calculate which field was sending the value.
